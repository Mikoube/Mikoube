# Linux Enumeration Facility

### What's the goal ?

This is just a simple script that will copy (for the moment) 3 very well known enumeration script for Linux in the current working folder.

Then, the script will generate the command line to paste on the "victim" computer to download all scripts and  make a "chmod +x" in the same way. 
And finish with a lite http server on port 9000.
